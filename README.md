# YAHTZEE!!!

This is a simple yahtzee game I built with React. 

You can play it [here](https://yatzee.bensonley.com/)

## Score Validation

Score validation is now present for all scores. It's just not the most efficient way of validating. Don't judge me, improvements are coming - see optimizations below. ;)

## Optmizations

* There is room for some serious optimization is the methods used to calculate scores. This was actually the purpose for creating this little game, to improve my functional programming skills and do some cool stuff with Array methods.

* There is also some room for optimization in the React render process. I'll be adding some conditions to `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent unnecessary renders.

I hope you enjoy playing this digital version of Yahtzee.
